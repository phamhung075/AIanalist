Traders remained cautious as they anticipated interest rate decisions from major central banks, including the Fed, this week. Monday's data also pressured sentiment after the Indian trade deficit widened to the highest on record in November of USD 37.8 billion due to a surge in imports. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation eased to 1.89% in November from October's four-month high due to a softer rise in food prices. The Nifty 50 fell 1.0% to below 24,420, with notable losses from Shriram Finance (-3.4), Bajaj Finserve (-1.9%), Bharti Airtel (-1.7%), Grasim (-1.6%), and Power Grid (-1.5%).

Adding to the bearish mood was a slight fall in palm oil buying from top consumer India last month, coupled with New Delhi's ongoing efforts to ease import dependence and achieve self-reliance in edible oils over the medium to long term. Capping further declines were signs of rising demand from key buyer China ahead of the Lunar New Year festivals at the end of January.

Investors remain apprehensive about the government's ability to secure congressional approval for spending-cutting measures before the year-end recess, particularly in the absence of President Lula, who is recovering from surgery. Finance Minister Haddad's reassurances were insufficient to stabilize the market, despite significant Central Bank interventions totaling $4.6 billion through spot and line auctions. The interventions briefly eased pressure on the real but failed to counter the overall negative sentiment. Additionally, rising domestic interest rates and President Lula's criticism of the Central Bank's monetary policy further unsettled investors."

Investors remained skeptical about the government's fiscal credibility and the Central Bank's future stance, particularly with a new board set to take office in January. Lingering doubts over the prioritization of the inflation target were exacerbated by government criticism of recent monetary policy decisions. Additionally, the fiscal package, viewed as insufficient to stabilize public debt, has amplified fears of an unsustainable debt-to-GDP trajectory. Major banks were among the worst performers, with Banco Santander, Banco do Brasil, Ita\u00fasa, and Bradesco falling between 1% and 2%.

This matched stronger supply earlier in the year as rainfall in the production hub of Yunnan supported the creation of hydropower for smelters. In turn, Beijing\u2019s willingness to let the yuan devalue drove prices for base metals with Chinese manufacturing hubs to pull back in dollar-denominated exchanges. This balanced against soaring alumina prices due to supply disruptions and Beijing\u2019s decision to end tax rebates on exports of semi-manufactured aluminum products in December, removing around five million tonnes of supply from the international market, according to market players\u2019 estimates."

The latest data showed that China\u2019s coal output averaged 14.27 million tons per day in November, the highest on record, accelerating sharply from the 12.28 million tons per day in the previous month to set up another record-breaking year of coal production in 2024 for the world's top producer. The development took place as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, with slowing demand driving power-intensive industries to cut back on output. Increasing concerns that stimulus from Beijing will not be able to trigger growth maintained the bearish pressure on thermal coal prices. In turn, demand was further pressured by ample rainfall in key Chinese manufacturing hubs, allowing hydroelectric power to be preferred over coal power."

Meanwhile Rede D'Or added 2% following the approval of a R$450 million interest on equity payment and a new share buyback program, lifting investor sentiment. However, the upward momentum was limited by persistent concerns over Brazil's fiscal and monetary outlook. Investors remain skeptical about the government's fiscal credibility and the Central Bank's future stance, particularly with a new board set to take office in January. Doubts linger over the prioritization of the inflation target, exacerbated by government criticism of recent monetary policy decisions.

Domestically, a fresh PMI survey showed India's private sector growth accelerated to a four-month high in December, with manufacturing expanding faster and the services sector recording the largest growth since August. On the corporate front, losses in IT stocks, banks and steel companies weighed in the index."

In Germany, the private sector contracted for a sixth consecutive month, although services showed signs of recovery. Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote in Parliament as anticipated, setting the stage for snap elections early next year. Globally, the Fed is expected to cut the federal funds rate by 25bps this week, with signals of a slower pace of reductions in 2025. Meanwhile, the ECB delivered its fourth 25bps rate cut last week, adopting a cautious approach to further easing. However, many analysts believe the ECB may need to accelerate policy loosening to bolster the fragile Eurozone economy."

This latest reading indicated a return to growth, although the expansion remains insufficient to offset broader economic challenges. New business activity experienced its sharpest decline since September, with the pace of contraction accelerating across both monitored sectors. Meanwhile, employment in the services industry declined slightly, reflecting a cautious business environment marked by layoffs and hiring freezes amid an uncertain outlook. On the pricing front, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the fastest pace since April, while output charges climbed at the sharpest rate since February. Looking ahead, business expectations for future output edged higher from September\u2019s recent low but remained below the long-term average."

Subsequently, service providers experienced a notable rise in job creation, with overall employment growth reaching survey highs. Firms continued to expand their workforce in response to rising backlogs and new business opportunities. On the pricing front, a moderation in cost pressures helped ease charge inflation. Overall, business optimism among private sector companies strengthened for the second consecutive month, reaching its highest level since September 2023, as both manufacturers and service firms became more upbeat about the future outlook."

Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung backed the move, calling it a crucial step toward restoring stability and order. South Korean authorities are now moving to summon the impeached president for questioning regarding his brief martial law decree. At the same time, the Constitutional Court continues to deliberate on Yoon's potential removal or reinstatement."

Markets remain divided on whether the central bank will raise interest rates again or maintain its current stance when the decision is announced on Thursday. However, BOJ officials suggested last week that more time is needed to evaluate the latest economic data. Meanwhile, Japan's core machinery orders exceeded expectations in October, signaling a positive outlook for capital spending in the coming months. Additionally, manufacturing and services activity showed signs of improvement in December. Among individual stocks, notable gains were seen in index heavyweights such as Disco (+2.8%), Advantest (+2%), Fujikura (+2.3%), SoftBank Group (+1.1%), and Socionext (+5.3%)."

However, it marked the sixth consecutive month of contraction in factory activity as new orders continued to fall, with foreign sales declining faster. Meanwhile, output shrank slightly as higher workforce capacity supported the strongest clearance of backlogged orders since March. Delivery times continued to lengthen, though the rate of deterioration was softer than the previous month. On the pricing front, input cost inflation accelerated to a four-month high, while output cost inflation accelerated to its highest rate since July.

This increase also represented the second consecutive month of growth in the service sector, with new business inflows expanding the most in fours and continued expansion in employment. At the same time, the build-up of outstanding business was limited. On the export side, however, a contraction in demand deepened amid lingering global headwinds. Regarding prices, input prices increased at a steeper rate while average selling prices increased at the fastest pace in eight months. Lastly, the level of optimism was above average but eased amid concerns over labor constraints and the impact of rising costs."

It was the second straight month of growth in private sector activity and the strongest pace since September, largely driven by an acceleration in service sector expansion. Meanwhile, manufacturing output remained subdued, shrinking for the fourth month. New order growth quickened, with service firms seeing the fastest rise in new business in four months. Total employment rose further while backlogs of work declined after rising in November. However, foreign sales remained weak, down at a steeper rate. On inflation, input price gained the most in four months, due to the impact of the yen's weakness on inputs from abroad. Consequently, firms raised selling prices at a faster pace, marking the highest inflation rate since May. Finally, sentiment eased to the second-weakest in over three years, dragged by concerns over labor supply and the influence of high inflation on activity."

The increase was primarily driven by higher prices for non-alcoholic beverages, which rose by 4.4%, restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food by 3.3%, and grocery food, which saw a 2.5% increase. The rise in non-alcoholic beverages was largely due to higher soft drinks, water, and juices. On a monthly basis, food prices inched down by 0.1% in November, following a 0.9% drop in a month earlier. The largest contributor to the fall was vegetables, down 7.9%.

In key trade partner China, November's activity figures, including industrial output, retail sales, and the surveyed jobless rate, are also expected. Optimism that the US Fed will deliver another 25bps rate cut in its final meeting of the year on Wednesday helped to cap further declines.

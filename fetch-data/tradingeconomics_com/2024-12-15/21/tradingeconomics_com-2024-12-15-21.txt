Wang said there is room to further reduce the RRR from the current average level of 6.6%. Friday's data showed that China\u2019s banks extended CNY 580 billion in new yuan loans in November 2024, well below the market expectation of CNY 950 billion, and less than half of the CNY 1.170 trillion from the corresponding period of the previous year, highlighting weak credit demand in the mainland. Last Thursday, China said it would raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and loosen monetary policy to maintain a stable economic growth rate. As Reuters reported, China's economy is expected to grow by about 5% this year, citing Han Wenxiu, the deputy director of the country's central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission."

Despite stronger-than-expected economic activity at the start of Q4, evidenced by the 0.1% growth in the IBC-Br index for October, concerns persist over Brazil's fiscal outlook and the potential impact of restrictive monetary policy. While economic indicators such as retail and service sectr performance signal resilience, expectations for 2025 point to a slowdown amid tighter monetary and fiscal conditions and a labor market with limited room for further gains. Mega-cap miner Vale shed 1.7%, while big banks Banco Santander, Banco do Brasil, Ita\u00fasa, and Bradesco posted losses ranging from 0.4% to 1.3%. Meanwhile, healthcare leaders Rede D'Or and Raia Drogasil led the decline with sharp losses of 2.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The Ibovespa posted a weekly loss of 1.1%."

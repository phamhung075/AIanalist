Canada Stock Market
The S&P/TSX Composite Index reversed early gains to close 0.9% lower at 22,781 on Friday, mirroring a global selloff in risk assets as US recession fears were reignited by weaker-than-expected jobs data. Domestically, Canada’s unemployment rate climbed to 6.6% in August 2024, the highest since October 2021 and above forecasts of 6.5%, reinforcing the Bank of Canada’s view of a weakening labor market and supporting the case for further rate cuts. Economic activity also contracted for the first time in 13 months, with the Ivey PMI dropping to 48.2, its lowest since December 2020, amid slowing employment growth and intensified price pressures.

Crude Oil Hits Lowest Levels Since June 2023 Amid Supply and Demand Concerns
Commodity
WTI crude oil futures fell 2.1% to settle at $67.70 per barrel on Friday, marking their lowest level since June 2023, as OPEC+ struggled to ease market concerns about global supply and demand. OPEC+ postponed its planned production increase of 180,000 barrels per day until December, which would have added about 2.2 million barrels per day to the market through the end of next year. Meanwhile, recent economic data from China and the U.S. revealed weaknesses in their manufacturing sectors, raising fears of declining demand. Additionally, potential increases in oil supply from Libya, due to political factions nearing an agreement, added downward pressure. However, an unexpected large drawdown in U.S. crude inventories—down 6.9 million barrels, far exceeding the anticipated 1.1 million barrel draw—provided some relief. For the week, WTI oil prices experienced an 8% drop, booking their worst since October.

Brazil 10-Year Bond Yield Eases

The yield on Brazil’s 10-year government bond fell to 12%, retreating from a six-week high of 12.23% on September 2nd, tracking the decline in US Treasury yields and reflecting higher demand for safety amid concerns of an increasingly fragile US economy. Weaker job growth in the world’s largest economy intensified expectations for aggressive Fed rate cuts, with FOMC member Christopher Waller advocating for immediate rate reductions. Domestically, rising inflationary pressures and a widening budget deficit limited the retreat in local borrowing costs. These were lastly underscored by a BRL 21.3 billion deficit in July, raising inflation expectations and consequently, supporting bets of another rate hike by the BCB this year.

FTSE MIB Falls Over 3% for the Week
Italy Stock Market
The FTSE MIB dropped 1.17% to close at 33,291 on Friday, marking a new two-week low and aligning with the decline seen across other European indices. This selloff was driven by renewed concerns about the US economy following a disappointing jobs report, which led to a broad retreat from risk assets. The US labor market fell short of expectations in August, with significant downward revisions for June and July, exacerbating fears of an economic slowdown amidst recent weak manufacturing data and rising recession worries in the world's largest economy. Among the corporate decliners were Prysmian (-3.9%), STMicroelectronics (-3.1%), Banca Monte Paschi Siena (-2.7%), and Telecom Italia (-2.7%).

Fewer jobs were added to the US economy than expected in August, while payrolls for the prior months were revised lower, warranting FOMC member Christorpher Waller to sound the alarm on the fragility of the US labor market. The European tech sector tracked its US counterparts and led the declines, with ASML sinking 5.4% on the session and 16% on the week due to worries that the AI-led equity rally may have been exaggerated.

The FTSE 100 failed to recover and closed about 0.7% down at 8,181.5 on Friday, its lowest in nearly a month, extending losses for the sixth consecutive session. Global traders undertook a reassessment of the latest U.S. jobs report, which indicated a continued slowdown in the labor market, strengthening expectations of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

US 10-Year Treasury Note Falls to Over 15-Month Low
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell under 3.7% on Friday, the lowest in over 15 months, as evidence of a softening labor market strengthened bets of multiple aggressive rate cuts by the Fed this year. The US economy added 142 thousand jobs in August, below expectations of 160 thousand, while payrolls for the previous month were revised downward by 25 thousand. This drove FOMC member Christopher Waller to warn that the Fed must immediately respond with rate cuts, adding that the urgency for less restrictive rates may warrant a 50bps slash to kick off the bank’s cutting cycle. This added to earlier data that aligned with worries of fragility in the US labor market, triggering a clear dovish pivot by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his Jackson Hole speech. Consequently, investors piled on bets of 125bps in Fed cuts this year, compared to 100bps from the end of August. In the meantime, the yield on the 2-year note fell below that of the 10-year for the first time since 2021.

Stocks in the US failed to hold early gains on Friday, with the S&P 500 sinking about 1%, the Dow Jones losing about 250 points and the Nasdaq plunging 1.7%.

Traders are now pricing in a nearly 40% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 50bps later in the month, compared to about 50% right after the payrolls release and 30% early in the week.

Euro Eases from 1-Week High
Euro Area Currency
The euro weakened below $1.108 mark after touching a one-week high of $1.111 on September 5th as investors assessed the latest economic data for hints on the magnitude of rate cuts by the ECB and the Fed. GDP growth in the Eurozone was revised lower to 0.2% during the second quarter, aligning with concerns that restrictive monetary policy is impacting the bloc’s economy to a larger extent, especially in its largest member, Germany. Consequently, markets piled on bets that the central bank will extend its cutting momentum with another 25bps rate cut next week. Still, the currency pair remained 3.4% higher since the start of the third quarter as evidence of a softening US labor market strengthened bets of a dovish Fed. This was underscored by back-to-back soft non-farm payroll numbers released by the BLS in August, driving markets to position for a series of rate cuts by the US central bank.

UK 10-Year Gilt Bond Yield Below Recent Highs
United Kingdom Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the UK 10-year gilt was around 3.94% as the latest jobs report for the US raised bets the Fed will cut interest rates by 50bps this month. The US economy added less jobs than expected and figures for both June and July were revised sharply lower. In the UK, the Bank of England is likely to maintain rates at its September 19th meeting, but could cut by 25bps in November. Next week, several key indicators will provide an update on the UK economy, including unemployment rate, wage growth, monthly GDP and industrial production.

Euro Eases from 1-Week High
Euro Area Currency
The euro weakened below $1.108 mark after touching a one-week high of $1.111 on September 5th as investors assessed the latest economic data for hints on the magnitude of rate cuts by the ECB and the Fed. GDP growth in the Eurozone was revised lower to 0.2% during the second quarter, aligning with concerns that restrictive monetary policy is impacting the bloc’s economy to a larger extent, especially in its largest member, Germany. Consequently, markets piled on bets that the central bank will extend its cutting momentum with another 25bps rate cut next week. Still, the currency pair remained 3.4% higher since the start of the third quarter as evidence of a softening US labor market strengthened bets of a dovish Fed. This was underscored by back-to-back soft non-farm payroll numbers released by the BLS in August, driving markets to position for a series of rate cuts by the US central bank.

Canadian Dollar Weakens After Unemployment
Canada Currency
The Canadian dollar weakened past 1.35 per USD, pulling back from the five-month high of 1.344 on August 27th, as investors absorbed the latest labor market data in Canada and the US. Canada’s unemployment rate rose to 6.6% in August from 6.4% in July, the highest since October 2021 and above the forecasted 6.5%, reinforcing the Bank of Canada's outlook for a cooling labor market and justifying continued monetary easing. This sentiment aligned with the BoC’s recent 25bps rate cut, where policymakers highlighted concerns over slowing job growth and downside risks to the broader economy. However, Governor Macklem noted persistent price pressures in the housing market and select services, maintaining inflationary challenges, which was interpreted as hawkish and supported the loonie. Meanwhile, in the US, disappointing job growth in August and downward revisions for June and July fueled speculation of a significant Federal Reserve rate cut, pressuring the US dollar.

Gold Rises Toward Record High
Commodity
Gold rose to over $2,520 per ounce on Friday, set to close near its record high as the US jobs report consolidated the softening trend for the US labor market, adding to bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver multiple aggressive rate cuts this year. The US economy added 142 thousand jobs in August, below expectations of a 160 thousand increase, while the payroll count from the previous month was revised downwards by 25 thousand. The report culminated a week of pessimistic labor market data, including downward surprises for the ADP report, the Challenger report, and the JOLTS. Consequently, the market pivoted to a loose consensus that the Federal Reserve will deliver 125bps in rate cuts in its three remaining decisions this year instead of expectations of 100bps in cuts from the start of the week. Less restrictive monetary policy favors gold as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing bullion assets.

US 10-Year Treasury Yield Slumps to 16-Month Low
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.67% on Friday, the lowest in nearly 16 months, as evidence of a softening labor market strengthened bets of multiple aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. The jobs report showed that the US economy added 142 thousand jobs in August, below expectations of 160 thousand, while payrolls for the previous month were revised downward by 25 thousand. This added to earlier labor reports that echoed a similar trend, aligning with worries of fresh fragility in the US labor market that triggered a clear dovish pivot by Fed Chair Powell during his Jackson Hole speech. Consequently, investors piled on bets of 125bps in Fed cuts this year, compared to 100bps from the end of August. In the meantime, the yield on the 2-year note fell below that of the 10-year for the first time since 2021.

The number of unemployed people rose by 60,400 from the previous month to 1,458,900, particularly due to increases in unemployment for the core working age (+0.4pp to 5.7%) and the older population (+0.4 pp to 5.5%).

India Foreign Exchange Reserves Extend Record High
India Foreign Exchange Reserves
Foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank of India surged to an equivalent of $684 billion as of August 30th, the highest on record. The elevated levels were owed to the robust influx of foreign exchange into the Indian economy, as strong growth and the long-awaited inclusion of Indian assets to JPMorgan’s key emerging market debt index supported foreign investment. This was reflected by the Sensex reaching record highs and the yield on the 10-year G-Sec falling well below the 7% threshold. Additionally, the rebound for the yen and the yuan drove the RBI to prioritize the competitiveness of Indian exports, and likely drove the central bank to purchase foreign exchange, propping up its reserves.

World Food Prices Slow
World Food Price Index
The FAO Food Price Index edged lower to 120.7 in August 2024, the lowest in three months, from an upwardly revised 121 in July. Cereal prices fell 0.5% to the lowest level since September 2020, mainly due to a drop in wheat export prices, reflecting a sluggish international demand and strong competition among exporters, especially from Black Sea supplies. Higher-than-previously-expected wheat production in Argentina and the US also contributed to the softer price tone. Sugar prices dropped 4.7% and reached their lowest since October 2022, amid an improving production outlook for the 2024/25 season in Thailand and India, following favourable rainfall. Also, meat cost decreased 0.7%. In contrast, prices for vegetable oils went up 0.8% as a rise in world palm oil more than offset lower soy, sunflower and rapeseed oil quotations. In addition, dairy prices rose 2.2%, led by whole milk powder due to a surge in import demand for spot supplies and tight inventories in major producing regions.

At the same time, new automobile sales picked up in the month, and eating out increased. Simultaneously, both consumer and producer prices were relatively higher. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan raised its key short-term interest rate at its July meeting to around 0.25% from the prior range of 0 to 0.1% it set in March.

Palm Oil Set to Finish Week on Low Note
Commodity
Malaysian palm oil futures were below MYR 3,890 per tonne, giving up gains from the prior session and pointing to a slump of over 2% due to an extended rise in ringgit. Caution also grew after Reuters forecast Malaysia's palm oil inventories climbed to a six-month top at the end of August, on weak exports. Cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services said the country's shipments fell almost 10% mom. Separately, Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil grower, plans to cut export levies on palm oil to enhance its competitiveness against other vegetable oils and lift farmers' income, which could further pressure Malaysia’s export market. Turning to top buyer India, palm oil imports tumbled 27% in August amid abundant stocks and negative margins that prompted refiners to reduce purchases. Elsewhere, crude oil prices are on track to fall for the fourth straight week, largely due to persistent demand concerns from China. Still, sluggish palm oil production in recent months limited the decline.

South Korean Won Climbs to Over 1-Week High
South Korea Currency
The South Korean won climbed past 1,330 per dollar, hitting its highest levels in over a week as the dollar weakened on softening US economic data which fanned recession worries and spurred bets on more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts. Domestically, investors reacted to data showing South Korea’s current account surplus narrowed in July as imports increased while exports fell slightly. Data earlier this week also showed that the country’s annual inflation rates slowed to 2% in August from 2.6% in July, the lowest reading since March 2021. The latest figure marked the fifth consecutive month that price growth stayed below 3%, supporting the view that the Bank of Korea may start cutting interest rates soon. The BOK recently revised its inflation and GDP growth forecasts lower for this year, signaling readiness to lower borrowing costs.

Australia 10-Year Yield Tracks US Yield Lower
Australia Government Bond 10Y
Australia's 10-year government bond yield fell below 3.94%, tracking a decline in US bond yields as investors braced for US jobs data due later today, which could dictate the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts. In Australia, RBA Governor Michele Bullock on Thursday reiterated that it was premature to consider near-term rate cuts due to elevated inflation, maintaining a hawkish stance even as data showed the economy remained sluggish in the second quarter. She noted that the board is alert to upside risks to inflation and that policy will need to remain sufficiently restrictive until it moves sustainably toward its 2-3% target range. Earlier this week, data revealed that Australia’s economy grew 0.2% in the June quarter, missing forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Annual growth slowed to 1% from 1.3% in Q1, reaching levels not seen since the 1990s recession, except distortions from the pandemic. In other economic news, Australia’s trade surplus widened in July, as exports rose while imports fell.

Gold Steady Ahead of US Jobs Report
Commodity
Gold steadied near $2,520 per ounce on Friday, hovering near one-week highs ahead of the much-anticipated US jobs report, which could strengthen expectations for a substantial interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates could reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Recent data showed a weakening labor market, with ADP reporting that US private employers hired the fewest number of workers in 3.5 years in August. This, along with a sharp decline in US job openings in July and subdued manufacturing activity, raised concerns about the US economy's health and fueled expectations of a substantial 50 basis point Fed rate cut this month. However, the unexpected rise in the ISM Services PMI, driven by increases in new orders and prices, alleviated some concerns. Nevertheless, markets are currently pricing in a 41% chance of a 50 basis point cut and have increased bets on a total of 125 basis points in cuts for the year. Over the week, gold is set to advance.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to around 3.72% on Friday, sliding toward 15-month lows as investors prepared for the August payrolls report that could cement expectations for a supersized 50 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month.

Previous data also showed that job openings unexpectedly fell to an over three-year low in July and manufacturing activity contracted more than anticipated in August. The latest batch of economic reports fanned recession worries, prompting traders to price in more aggressive rate cuts from the Fed.

On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to start cutting interest rates this month amid rising labor market risks and broader economic weakness.

Oil Set for Sharp Weekly Loss
Commodity
WTI crude oil futures traded around $69.4 per barrel on Friday, poised to decline sharply over the week due to demand concerns from major oil markets. Recent data from China and the US revealed weakness in their manufacturing sectors, heightening fears of slowing demand. Additionally, potential increases in oil supply from Libya added downward pressure, following signals that political factions in Libya are nearing an agreement. However, some relief came from an unexpected large drawdown in US crude inventories. EIA data showed that US crude stocks fell by 6.9 million barrels last week, significantly exceeding market expectations of a 1.1 million barrel draw and marking the ninth consecutive decline in oil stocks over the last ten months. Furthermore, crude prices received support after OPEC+ decided to pause its planned crude production increase for the fourth quarter.

Brazilian Real Advanced for 2nd Session
Brazil Currency
The Brazilian real strengthened past 5.6 per USD, rebounding from a near one-month low of 5.65 seen on September 3rd, driven by a weakening US dollar and hawkish expectations for the Brazilian central bank. Market participants widely anticipate a 25 basis point rate hike by the BCB as inflationary pressures intensify, exacerbated by increased fiscal spending reflected in the latest GDP figures. While government transfers have helped sustain spending, this dependence raises concerns about the sustainability of Brasilia's expansionary fiscal policies, contributing to higher inflation expectations. The budget deficit widened significantly to BRL 21.3 billion in July, far exceeding forecasts and fueling fears that the government will maintain its revised fiscal stance. Meanwhile, the US dollar traded near thirteen-month lows amid intensified bets for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed, spurred by fresh evidence of a cooling labor market in the US.

Wall Street Closes Mixed Ahead of August Job Report
United States Stock Market
Stocks in the US finished a volatile session mixed on Thursday as investors adjusted their positions ahead of Friday’s crucial labor report. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones fell 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Nasdaq 100 booked marginal gains after initially rising more than 1%.The market was influenced by new labor market data that provided mixed signals about the U.S. economy’s health. Private payrolls growth in August was the weakest since January 2021, with only 99,000 new jobs created, significantly below expectations. However, weekly unemployment claims declined, offering some relief. The conflicting data, which also included a drop in job openings, contributed to concerns about a potential recession and the Federal Reserve's approach to rate cuts. Among sectors, health led the losses with a 3.5% drop in share of Eli Lilly and a 1.5% fall in shares of UnitedHealth, while consumer discretionary advanced the most, as Amazon (+2.6%) and Tesla (4.9%) outperformed.

Oil Settles Near 14-Month Low
Commodity
WTI crude futures settled at $69.1 per barrel on Thursday, remaining near a 14-month low, as concerns over slowing demand in the U.S. and China, combined with the potential for increased oil supply from Libya, outweighed a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a 6.9 million barrel reduction in stockpiles for the week ending August 30, well above forecasts. At the same time, OPEC+ delayed planned production hikes for October and November, which analysts at Jefferies estimate will tighten fourth-quarter supply by 100,000-200,000 barrels per day. In Libya, despite political tensions, tankers began loading crude again. Meanwhile, positive U.S. economic data calmed fears over the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate cuts, with many anticipating a reduction at its September meeting. Lower rates could help spur economic growth and boost oil demand.

Brazil Trade Surplus Plummets 49.9%
Brazil Balance of Trade
Brazil's trade surplus plunged by 49.9% to $4.83 billion in August 2024, significantly missing expectations of a $6.1 billion surplus, as imports rose while exports declined. Exports dropped 6.5% year-on-year to $29.08 billion, mainly due to a sharp 19.1% decrease in agricultural exports, which totaled $6.18 billion, and an 8.1% decline in extractive industry exports to $6.61 billion. In contrast, imports surged by 13.0% to $24.25 billion, driven by a 12.5% increase in manufacturing purchases to $22.27 billion, a 21.6% rise in extractive industry imports to $1.4 billion, and an 18.7% growth in agricultural imports, reaching $0.44 billion.

Gasoline Drops to February 2021 Lows
Commodity
US gasoline futures fell toward $1.9 per gallon in September, the lowest since February 2021, amid a broader slump in the oil market driven by reduced fuel demand. This decline was fueled by recent US economic data signaling lower demand amid a cooling labor market, which intensified concerns over contracting factory activity. Additionally, eased supply constraints from Libya and weak Chinese manufacturing data further pressured the market. China's factory activity saw its sharpest decline of the year, heightening fears that Beijing's lack of stimulus will suppress demand for energy-intensive goods, a trend mirrored by reduced earnings for major Chinese oil producers. These developments have fueled speculation that OPEC+ may soon agree to delay its planned production increase set for October.

US Stocks Lack Direction in Afternoon Trading
United States Stock Market
US stocks fluctuated on Thursday afternoon trading as markets heeded increased risk ahead of the key BLS jobs report tomorrow. The S&P 500 and the Dow lost 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq was slightly above the flatline. Other data released this week set a pessimistic precedent for the key jobs data on Friday, with the ADP showing that private-sector job growth fell to a 2021-low, while the Challenger Report showed a surge in job cuts and the JOLTS underscored lower job openings, aligning with Fed Chair Powell’s concerns of a softening labor market that preceded aggressive dovish signals. On the other hand, the ISM Services PMI beat forecasts and pointed to the strongest growth in the services sector in three months. Companies in traditional sectors of the economy declined, resulting in the Dow’s underperformance with healthcare, industrials, and consumer staples sinking the most. On the other hand, tech edged higher with gains for Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon.

Mexican Peso Depreciates to Nearly 2-Year Low
Mexico Currency
The Mexican peso fell towards 20 per USD in early September, reaching its lowest level since October 2022, following the passage of controversial judicial reforms by Mexico's lower house on September 4. These reforms, which propose electing judges through popular vote instead of appointment, have raised concerns about potential threats to judicial independence and foreign investment. Critics argue that the reforms may not effectively combat corruption and could negatively impact international trade. This has heightened fears of decreased foreign investment and further depreciation of the peso. Additionally, Mexico's unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in July, its highest since January, and the manufacturing PMI fell to 48.5 in August, marking the sharpest contraction in two years, pressuring the Bank of Mexico to lower borrowing costs.

Central Bank of Egypt Keeps Interest Rate Unchanged for the Third Time
Egypt Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Egypt maintained interest rate at a record high of 27.25% on September 5th, for the third consecutive meeting, reflecting recent global and domestic economic developments. Domestically, Inflation continued to ease, with headline inflation dropping to 25.7% in July, driven by a significant reduction in food prices. Meanwhile, Real GDP growth slowed to 2.2% in Q1 2024, down from 2.3% in Q4 2023, mainly due to disruptions in Red Sea maritime trade, impacting the service sector. However, Leading indicators suggest a gradual recovery in Q2 2024, with growth expected to improve in fiscal year 2024/25. Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to 6.5% in Q2 2024, supported by gains in the agricultural sector. The Central Bank expects inflation to remain stable until Q4 2024, with a sharper decline anticipated in early 2025 due to ongoing fiscal and monetary tightening.

US 30-Year Mortgage Rate Remains at Over 1-Year Low
United States 30 Year Mortgage Rate
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage held steady at 6.35% as of September 5th, remaining at its lowest level since mid-May 2023, according to Freddie Mac. This decrease aligns with falling long-term Treasury yields amid a softening labor market, as weaker-than-expected private job growth and rising job cuts fueled speculation of aggressive Fed rate cuts. In the same period last year, the rate on a 30-year benchmark mortgage was 7.12%. “Mortgage rates remained flat this week as markets await the release of the highly anticipated August jobs report,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s Chief Economist. “Even though rates have come down over the summer, home sales have been lackluster. On the refinance side however, homeowners who bought in recent years are taking advantage of declining mortgage rates in order to lower their monthly payments.”.

Heating Oil Rebounds
Commodity
Heating oil futures in the US climbed toward $2.20 per gallon, recovering from the December 2021 low of $2.15 reached on September 4th, as prices tracked the broader oil market higher amid evidence of tightening supply and OPEC+’s intent to maintain production cuts. The latest EIA report showed a substantial 6.873 million barrel decline in oil stockpiles for the week ending August 30th, over six times the expected draw. The results magnified speculation that OPEC+ is nearing an agreement to delay its planned production increase set for October. Distillate stocks also fell by 0.373 million barrels, contrary to the anticipated 1 million barrel build. However, a significant 0.939 million barrel rise in heating oil inventories, offsetting most of the previous week’s over 1 million barrel draw, tempered the rally in heating oil prices.

In addition, EIA data showed a significant drop in US crude inventories by 6.87 million barrels last week, much larger than the anticipated 1.1 million barrel drawdown. However, oil prices remain close to December-lows, amid persistent concerns about weak demand. Data from China highlighted sluggish economic growth and declining factory demand, while the ISM Manufacturing PMI revealed that US factory activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month.

Natural Gas Soars to Near 2-Month High
Commodity
US natural gas futures rose to above $2.26 per MMBtu in early September, the highest in nearly two months, as supply pressures coincided with steady demand. New data from the EIA showed that 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas were added to US storages on the last week of August, below seasonal averages for the period, and less than half of market expectations of a 28 billion cubic feet build. This challenged earlier views of a more ample supply domestically amid a slowdown in LNG shipments. Also, the US National Hurricane Center noted that tropical disturbances could develop into a cyclone in the Gulf region, threatening LNG shipments. Also supporting prices, the Midwest saw record-high temperatures over the weekend, with over 60 million people receiving alerts for intense heat, increasing activity for air conditioners.

Ecuador Inflation Rate Slows in August
Ecuador Inflation Rate
The annual inflation rate in Ecuador eased to 1.28% in August 2024, slowing from the 1.57% increase recorded the previous month. This slowdown was primarily driven by a drop in prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages (-0.86% vs. 0.37% in July), restaurants and hotels (1.97% vs. 2.45%), communications (2.55% vs. 2.59%), and recreation and culture (0.99% vs. 1.19%), and transportation (3.20% vs. 3.60%), while the decline in costs for clothing and footwear accelerated (-0.71% vs. -0.41%). Conversely, prices accelerated for education (1.74% vs. 1.73%), housing and utilities (1.09% vs. 0.29%), and education (1.74% vs. 1.73%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.22%, rebounding from a 0.93% decrease in July.

10-Year Treasury Yield Holds Near 3.75%
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note trimmed earlier losses but held below 3.75% on Thursday, its lowest in nearly 15 months, as robust demand for US services weighed against an increasingly soft labor market. The ISM Services PMI unexpectedly inched higher in August with higher new orders and prices, trimming the room for aggressive rate cuts by the Fed. Still, the ADP showed that private businesses added much fewer jobs than expected in August, and other reports reflected a surge in the number of job cuts and fewer job openings than expected. This raised concerns that tomorrow’s BLS jobs report might point to another soft number, aligning with worries of a softer labor market that triggered a clear dovish pivot by Fed Chair Powell in his Jackson Hole speech. Consequently, investors piled on bets of 125bps in Fed cuts this year, compared to 100bps from the end of August. In the meantime, the yield on the 2-year note fell below that of the 10-year for the first time since 2021.

US Services Activity Unexpectedly Accelerates: ISM
United States Non Manufacturing PMI
The ISM Services PMI in the US edged higher to 51.5 in August of 2024 from 51.4 in the previous month, above market expectations that it would ease to 51.1, to extend the positive momentum in activity for US service providers. New orders extended the prior month’s rebound (53 vs 52.4 in July) to reflect robust demand from clients, although production levels rose at a softer pace (53.3 vs 54.5) despite the fresh depletion in the backlog of orders (43.7 vs 50.6). In the meantime, employment levels edged marginally higher (50.2 vs 51.1), just enough to prevent the sixth monthly contraction of the year. Still, the ISM’s price gauge accelerated further (57.3 vs 57), ahead of market expectations of a slowdown, amid higher costs in construction services, electrical equipment, food, and labor.

In the meantime, staffing levels were down for the first time in three months, as both sectors reported declines. As for prices, input costs continued to rise sharply in August, though the rate of selling price inflation slowed to a seven-month low, driven by a more modest increase in the services sector.

Canada Service Activity Shrinks for the 3rd Month
Canada Services PMI
The S&P Global Canada Services PMI rose slightly to 47.8 in August 2024, up from 47.3 in July, signaling a slower but still pronounced contraction in the services sector, marking the third consecutive month of decline. Both activity and new business volumes continued to fall, with several firms attributing reduced activity to soft market demand and ongoing wildfire impacts. Net employment declined for the first time this year, partly due to difficulties in replacing staff. Cost pressures remained elevated, driven by higher salaries and wages, prompting service providers to increase output charges at the fastest rate in three months. Despite some optimism for a market revival fueled by lower interest rates, overall confidence dropped to its lowest level since January, reflecting worries about sustained high borrowing costs and potential disruptions from railway strikes.

Canada Composite PMI
The S&P Global Canada Composite PMI edged up to 47.8 in August 2024 from 47.0 in July, but remained in contraction in private sector activity for the third consecutive month. This decline was driven by comparable downturns in both manufacturing and services, with new orders dropping at the sharpest pace since February. Consequently, marginal job losses were recorded for the first time since December, while backlogs continued to decrease, highlighting excess capacity. Although input price inflation remained stable, firms raised output charges at the fastest pace since May. Confidence in future output dropped to its lowest level since January, underscoring growing concerns over the economic outlook.

Baltic Dry Index Edges Higher
Commodity
The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index, which tracks rates for ships ferrying dry bulk commodities, rebounded by 0.9% to 1,919 points on Thursday, after a 2.3% drop in the prior session, driven by the bigger size segment. The capesize index, which typically transports 150,000-ton cargoes, such as iron ore and coal, rose by 1.9% to 1,919 points, due to constrained supply brought on by longer ton-miles and limited new capacity, according to Jefferies. Meanwhile, the panamax index, which usually carries about 60,000-70,000 tons of coal or grain cargo, eased 6 points to an over one-year low of 1,294 points. Among smaller vessels, the supramax index shed 5 points at 1,266 points.

The ADP report showed US private companies added the fewest jobs since January 2021 and wage growth stabilized while initial claims fell more than expected. Yesterday, the JOLTS report showed the number of job openings fell way more than anticipated to 2021-lows, reinforcing expectations the labor market is cooling off, and raising bets for a 50bps cut by the Fed this month. The highly-anticipated jobs report is due tomorrow. On the corporate front, megacaps were mixed in premarket trading, with Microsoft (-0.5%), Apple (-0.4%), Nvidia (-1.1%), Meta (-0.6%) and Alphabet (-0.6%) booking losses while Amazon (0.9%) traded in the green.

US 10-Year Treasury Yield Sinks Toward 15-Month Low
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note fell below the 3.75% threshold on Thursday, its lowest in nearly 15 months, as an increasingly pessimistic economic backdrop consolidated bets of a large magnitude of rate cuts by the Fed this year. The ADP report showed that private businesses added less than 100 thousand jobs in August, well below market expectations of 145 thousand, other reports reflected a surge in the number of job cuts and fewer job openings than expected. This raised concerns that tomorrow’s BLS jobs report might point to another soft number, aligning with worries of a softer labor market that triggered a clear dovish pivot by Fed Chair Powell in his Jackson Hole speech. Consequently, markets increased their bets that the US central bank could deliver 125bps through the three remaining decisions this year, compared to 100bps from the end of August. In the meantime, the yield on the 2-year note fell below that of the 10-year for the first time since 2021.

Private businesses in the US added 99K workers to their payrolls in August 2024, the lowest number since January 2021, following a downwardly revised 111K in July and well below forecasts of 145K.

Meanwhile, the goods-producing sector added 27K jobs in construction (27K) and natural resources/mining (8K) while manufacturing shed 8K jobs. Year-over-year, pay gains were flat, remaining at 4.8% for job-stayers and 7.3% for job-changers. "The job market's downward drift brought us to slower-than-normal hiring after two years of outsized growth", said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP.

Oil Edges Up as OPEC+ Is Close to Delay Output Increase
Commodity
WTI crude futures were up to trade around $69.5 per barrel on Thursday, after losing nearly 6.5% in the previous two sessions, amid reports that OPEC+ is close to an agreement to delay a planned oil output increase of 180,000 barrels a day, due to start in October. However, oil prices remain close to December-lows, amid persistent concerns about weak demand. Data from China highlighted sluggish economic growth and declining factory demand, while the ISM Manufacturing PMI revealed that US factory activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month. In addition, API data showed a significant drop in US crude inventories by 7.4 million barrels last week, much larger than the anticipated 0.9 million barrel drawdown.

US Job Cuts Rise to 5-Month High
United States Challenger Job Cuts
US employers announced 75,891 job cuts in August 2024, the most in five months, and the most for the month since 2009 when excluding the pandemic-induced crash in 2020. The result was in line with other key releases in reflecting the softening of the US labor market, strengthening the rhetoric for doves in the FOMC. Among different sectors, tech companies announced the most cuts (39,563). “August’s surge in job cuts reflects growing economic uncertainty and shifting market dynamics. Companies are facing a variety of pressures, from rising operational costs to concerns about a potential economic slowdown, leading them to make tough decisions about workforce management,” said Andrew Challenger, Senior Vice President of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. So far this year, companies have announced 536,421 job cuts, a 3.7% decline from the corresponding period of the prior year.

Indian 10-Year Yield Falls to Over-2-Year Low
India Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the Indian 10-year government bond held below the 6.85% mark in September, its lowest level in over two years amid bets of incoming dovish pivots from the Fed and the RBI, in addition to a strong fiscal backdrop. The latest data showed that Indian inflation fell below the RBI’s target at 3.7% in July, the softest in five years, while GDP growth slowed more than expected to 6.7% annually in the June quarter. The data added to bets of an RBI rate cut in October, aligning with the incoming monetary loosening by the Fed. This magnified the support for bonds from the prudent fiscal backdrop set by the Indian government, reducing the risk premium on bonds and lowering the outlook of debt supply in the financial year. Consequently, foreign funds have been piled on Indian debt since last year, lastly underscored by the inclusion of Indian G-Secs in JPMorgan’s emerging market index.

Lithium Holds at Over 3-Year Low
Commodity
Lithium carbonate prices steadied at the CNY 75,000 per tonne mark in September, the lowest in over three years, due to persistent concerns about an oversupplied market. Lithium miners and producers in China continued to expand capacity and hunt for new reserves, with market players expecting global supply to soar by nearly 50% this year. This magnified the current supply surplus amid the fallout of the battery glut due to government subsidies for firms across the supply chain. Additionally, hopes of eventual balance in the market drove Chile to signal it would aim to double output over the next decade, and the race to secure battery metals drove China to expand projects in Africa. Adding to the bearish pressure, the EU placed a 9% tariff on Tesla EVs produced in China, adding to trade barriers against China-based EV manufacturers ranging from 36.3% and 17%. Also, the US quadrupled duties on Chinese EVs to 100%, pushing against input materials for battery producers.

Ireland Current Account
The current account surplus in Ireland widened sharply to EUR 35.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024 from EUR 11.35 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year, marking the widest surplus on record. The surge was largely due to the jump in service exports (+EUR 32.5 billion to EUR 130.1 billion) in the period amid strong demand for research and development, intellectual property, and computer service exports from the multinational corporations that are headquartered in Ireland, lifting the services surplus to EUR 24.5 billion. In the meantime, the goods balance was at a surplus of EUR 39.4 billion, widening slightly from EUR 35.8 billion in the previous year. Also contributing to the wider current account surplus, the primary income gap eased to EUR 27.4 billion from EUR 30.5 billion.

Germany Construction Sector Shrinks the Most in 3 Months
Germany Construction PMI
The HCOB Germany Construction PMI fell to 38.9 in August 2024 from 40 in the previous month, marking the 29th consecutive month of contraction and the steepest decline since May. The downturn was primarily driven by a sharp fall in the housing sector, which experienced its most significant decline since April. In contrast, the civil engineering sector recorded its smallest decline since February. New orders continued to decrease, extending the ongoing downturn to nearly two and a half years. Meanwhile, job shedding accelerated to its fastest rate since May, as companies intensified efforts to streamline staffing levels. Looking ahead, constructors remained pessimistic about the 12-month outlook for output, citing shrinking order books, broader economic concerns, high construction costs, and elevated interest rates.

Italian Construction Sector Downturn Eases Slightly
Italy Construction PMI
The HCOB Italy Construction PMI edged up to 46.6 in August 2024, from a near two-year low of 45 in July, signaling the fifth consecutive month of contraction in the country's construction sector, but at the slowest pace in three months. Business activity continued to be impacted by falling new orders, which declined at the sharpest rate in two years. While downturns softened across all three monitored sectors, housing and civil engineering activity remained at alarmingly low levels. In response to weaker demand, both purchasing activity and employment were further reduced. On the price front, both input costs and subcontractor rates have risen further compared to July, attributed to higher raw material costs. Looking forward, confidence in future activity dropped to a two-year low.

French Construction Sector Stays Subdued
France Construction PMI
The S&P Global France Construction PMI edged up to 40.1 in August 2024, little-changed from July's six-month low of 39.7. The latest reading pointed to another steep monthly fall in France’s construction activity, as the sector continued to grapple with weak demand due to restrictive interest rate and high charges. All three monitored construction segments reported declines in activity, with the housing sector experiencing the sharpest contraction. New orders continued to drop, albeit at the slowest pace in three months. Additionally, employment across the sector decreased. Construction companies also reduced their purchasing activity for the sixteenth consecutive month. Meanwhile, suppliers' delivery times were shortened to the greatest extent since December 2017. On the cost front, input prices rose at the fastest pace so far this year. Finally, French constructors remained pessimistic about the 12-month outlook for activity, amid concerns over a potential worsening in demand.

Slovakia Q2 GDP Confirmed at 1-Year Low
Slovakia GDP Annual Growth Rate
Slovakia's economy grew by 1.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, consistent with preliminary estimates and compared to a two-year high of 2.7% gain in the previous month. This marked the fourteenth consecutive period of economic expansion, though at the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2023, as domestic demand rose for the second consecutive time (5.4%), amid increased household consumption (2.5%) driven by falling inflation. Also, government spending climbed 4.8%. Moreover, gross capital formation saw a double digit growth rate at 15.4%, due to significant changes in inventories and lower investment activity. Meanwhile, net trade contributed negatively to the country's GDP, as imports (6%) rose faster than exports (2.5%). On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the economy edged down to 0.4% in Q2 of 2024 from 0.7% growth in the previous period.

Eurozone Construction Sector Sees Another Sharp Decline
Euro Area Construction PMI
The HCOB Eurozone Construction PMI remained unchanged at 41.4 in August 2024, holding at its lowest level in six months. This reading indicated a sharp reduction in total construction activity across the euro area, with new orders dropping significantly, leading to a further slowdown in activity and continued declines in employment and purchasing. The contraction was widespread across all three monitored segments. Housing saw the steepest decline since April 2020, commercial activity matched July's sharp fall, and civil engineering, while the least affected, still experienced a notable drop. On the cost front, input prices rose modestly midway through the third quarter, with inflation hitting a six-month high but remaining below the long-term average. Looking ahead, euro area construction companies remained pessimistic about the outlook for the coming year, given ongoing signs of a steep downturn.

Iron Ore Plunges on Weak China Outlook
Commodity
Prices of iron ore cargoes with a 62% iron content plunged over 7% to $92.93 in early September, sinking to the lowest levels in nearly two years as weak economic data and demand prospects for steel in top consumer China hurt the outlook. Latest data showed that China’s manufacturing activity remained contractionary in August, while services sector growth slowed. Dwindling profits for Chinese steel mills also dented market sentiment further. Moreover, ongoing property sector woes in the country continued to weigh on demand for construction materials. Elsewhere, industry data pointed to rising iron ore inventories in key Chinese ports, reflecting soft demand conditions. In the US, weak manufacturing and labor market data reignited recession fears in the world’s largest economy, although hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts provided some support.

Malaysia Keep Rates Unchanged at 3%
Malaysia Interest Rate
The central bank of Malaysia maintained its key interest rate unchanged at 3% for the eight consecutive meeting in September 2024, matching market expectations, amid increasing optimism over the country's growth, inflation, and currency outlook.

Latest indicators pointed towards sustained strength in economic activity, driven by resilient domestic expenditure and higher export activity. For the year as a whole, average headline and core inflation are expected to remain within the earlier projected ranges and are unlikely to exceed 3%. However, the inflation outlook remained subject to the implementation of domestic policy measures, amid government plans to pursue reforms after the removal of some diesel subsidies

Silver Stabilizes on Fed Rate Cut Bets
Commodity
Silver stabilized above $28 per ounce, halting a recent decline as weak US manufacturing and labor market data spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates more aggressively to avert an economic downturn. Markets are pricing in higher odds of a supersized 50 basis point rate cut in September, with about 125 bps in total easing seen this year. However, prospects of a US recession dampens the demand outlook for materials including silver, prompting traders to rush for safer assets like the dollar, yen and government bonds. Silver has been a major beneficiary of the global push towards renewable energy, particularly from the solar industry, which relies heavily on the metal for photovoltaic cells.

Weakness in Palm Oil Persist
Commodity
Malaysian palm oil futures were below MYR 3,870 per tonne, continuing the downward momentum for the fourth session due to a stronger ringgit and a decline in rival oils in the Dalian market.

Cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services noted Malaysian shipments fell almost 10% from the prior month. In top buyer India, palm oil imports tumbled 27% in August, amid ample stocks and poor refining margins, which led refiners to cut their purchases. Meanwhile, Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil exporter, plans to lower export levies on palm oil to enhance its competitiveness against other vegetable oils and increase farmers' income, which could further pressure Malaysia’s export market.

Inflation Eases But Rate Cuts Premature: RBA Governor
Australia Interest Rate
The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to balance reducing inflation within a reasonable timeframe while maintaining as many gains in the labor market as possible, Governor Michele Bullock said in a speech. She added that inflation in the country has moderated substantially since its peak but remains above the midpoint of the 2–3% target, with underlying inflation, as measured by the trimmed mean, at 3.9% in June. It is expected to return to the intended range by the end of next year and approach the midpoint in 2026. "Our highest priority has been, and remains, to bring inflation down," Bullock noted. The central banker reiterated that it is too early to consider a monetary easing in Australia. "Circumstances may change, of course, and if economic conditions don’t evolve as expected, the board will respond accordingly." However, if the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, the central bank does not expect to be in a position to cut rates in the near future.

Australian Dollar Steadies Amid Bullock Remarks
Australia Currency
The Australian dollar stabilized above $0.672 after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock reiterated that the central bank decided to keep rates unchanged at the August meeting as inflation remains too high. However, she acknowledged that the RBA will aim to preserve gains made in the labor market while trying to bring inflation down toward the 2-3% target range. Investors also digested data showing Australia’s trade surplus rose to a five-month high in July as exports grew while import fell. Earlier this week, figures showed that Australia’s economy grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to June, holding steady for the third straight quarter but missing market expectations of 0.3%. Externally, the Aussie benefited from a pullback in the US dollar as weak US economic data fueled recession fears and spurred bets on more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Japan’s 10-year government bond yield fell to around 0.87%, hitting a two-week low even after data showed that real wages in the country increased for the second straight month in July, bolstering a hawkish outlook on Bank of Japan monetary policy. Inflation-adjusted real wages rose 0.4% year-on-year in July as total cash earnings increased 3.6%. This comes in line with the BOJ’s outlook of moderate economic growth, rising wages and higher overall inflation. JGB yields also came under pressure from increased safe-haven demand as weak US manufacturing and labor market data fueled recession fears. Moreover, markets are betting that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates more aggressively to avert an economic downturn.

US 10-Year Yield Holds Decline on Dovish Fed Bets
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note held around 3.77% on Thursday after falling for two straight sessions, as weak manufacturing and labor market data prompted traders to price in more aggressive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. The yield curve on the 2-year and 10-year notes also turned positive for the first time in a month. The JOLTS report showed that job openings unexpectedly fell to an over three-year low in July, further fueling market concerns about a softening labor market. This added to the sharper-than-expected downturn in domestic manufacturing activity highlighted by the ISM PMI which triggered renewed fears of a recession. Markets now look ahead to the latest weekly jobless claims data on Thursday and the monthly jobs report on Friday to gain more clarity on the labor market. Markets are now placing higher odds on a larger 50 basis point rate cut this month and see about 125 bps in total easing for the year.

Gold Steady as US Jobs Data Approaches
Commodity
Gold held near $2,500 per ounce on Thursday as investors awaited the key US jobs report for more insights on the extent of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, which could reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. On Wednesday, JOLTS data revealed a much larger-than-expected drop in job openings to 2021 lows, reinforcing expectations of a slowing labor market and boosting speculation for a substantial 50 basis points cut by the Fed this month. This, coupled with the ISM PMI's sharp drop in US factory activity has raised doubts about the US economy’s resilience to higher interest rates. As a result, investors have increased their expectations for 125 basis points in rate cuts over the Fed’s remaining three meetings this year, up from last week’s consensus of 100 basis points. The key US jobs data is due on Friday.

Market participants cautiously awaited August trade figures in the mainland Saturday after readings in July showed exports grew less than expected while imports bounced back. Strong gains from the property sector came as financials rose modestly and consumers and tech were lower. Index leader Tencent Hlds. was subdued amid strong gains from SITC Intl.

The offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.09 per dollar, extending its gains from the previous session amid rising bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver a substantial 50 basis point rate cut later this month due to weak economic data.

Moreover, official data released last week highlighted a more complicated scenario, with manufacturing activity falling to its lowest level since February, while services activity saw a slight uptick from July's eight-month low. Traders are now focused on upcoming US payroll data due Friday, along with key economic indicators from China next week, including trade and inflation figures.

Oil Hovers Near 8-Month Low
Commodity
WTI crude oil futures traded around $69.6 per barrel on Thursday, staying near its lowest level in over eight months following recent heavy sell-off. Recent oil price pressures have been driven by concerns about oversupply, with OPEC planning to increase output and a potential deal between Libya's rival governments to resume oil production. However, a Reuters report indicated that OPEC+ is considering postponing its planned hike, scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter. Additionally, worries about demand continue to impact investor sentiment, following weak data from major oil markets. Data from China highlighted sluggish economic growth and declining factory demand, while the ISM Manufacturing PMI revealed that US factory activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month. Meanwhile, API data showed a significant drop in US crude inventories by 7.4 million barrels last week, much larger than the anticipated 0.9 million barrel drawdown.

The dollar index traded around 101.3 on Thursday after losing half a percent in the previous session, weighed down by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver a supersized 50 basis point rate cut later this month due to weak data. Markets are also pricing in about 125 bps in total easing this year, up from 100 bps last week.. The JOLTS report showed that job openings unexpectedly fell to an over three-year low in July, further fueling market concerns about a softening labor market. This added to the sharper-than-expected downturn in domestic manufacturing activity highlighted by the ISM PMI which triggered renewed fears of a recession. Markets now look ahead to the latest weekly jobless claims data on Thursday and the monthly jobs report on Friday to gain more clarity on the labor market. The dollar nursed losses against other major currencies, weakening the most versus the yen.

New Zealand Equities Extend Gains
New Zealand Stock Market
The stock market in New Zealand rose 36 points or 0.3% to 12,591 in early deals on Thursday, reaching higher for the second session amid rises from financials, energy, and utilities. A slowdown in the US labor market ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls data raised bets that the Fed might deliver a 50bps rate cut later this month. In Australia, sluggish economic output in the last three quarters matched the Reserve Bank's expectations, with economists viewing that the central bank won't make any sudden interest rate moves after Wednesday's numbers. Capping the bullish momentum was caution ahead of August trade figures over the weekend in China, New Zealand's top trading partner, after export growth slowed in July while imports rebounded. Meantime, private survey data showed that services activity in the mainland rose less than estimated last month. Several early gainers were Hallenstein Glasson Hlds. (2.2%), Ventia Services Group (1.8%), Infratil Ltd. (1.4%), and Meridian Energy (1.1%).

Ibovespa Rebounds
Brazil Stock Market
The Ibovespa climbed 1.3% to close at 136,111 on Wednesday, buoyed by robust performances in the consumer discretionary sector and major banks as investors digested recent economic data. Brazilian industrial production declined by 1.4% in July, partially offsetting the revised 4.3% surge in June. This weaker-than-expected result aligns with growing concerns of a slowdown in economic activity in the year's second half, as the drivers of early-year GDP growth appear set to fade, fueling dovish expectations from Brazil’s central bank. Leading the day’s gains, the consumer discretionary sector saw a strong performance on a day with few decliners. Stocks such as Magazine Luiza, JBS, Localiza, BRF, and Atacadão rallied between 1.9% and 4.3%, while Ambev, the beverage giant, rose 1.5%.

Oil Settles at $69.2, Lowest Since December
Commodity
WTI crude oil futures dropped by 1.6% to settle at $69.2 per barrel on Wednesday, reaching the lowest level since December 2023. This decline was due to growing pessimism about future demand, due to concerns about increasing supply and a potential deal between Libya's rival governments to resume oil production, which could add over 500,000 barrels per day to the market. Additional pressure on prices comes from OPEC's plan to boost production in the fourth quarter and ongoing worries about demand. Data from China indicated weak economic growth and declining factory demand, while the ISM Manufacturing PMI showed US factory activity contracting for the fifth consecutive month, contributing to the negative sentiment in the oil market.

Germany’s DAX closed 0.8% lower at 18,591, retreating sharply for a second session after reaching its record high on Monday as a batch of poor economic data triggered some global aversion to risk assets and pressured European equities. The pessimistic data was centered around a weaker-than-expected JOLTS survey in the US, challenging views that the Fed may achieve a soft landing, while a weak services PMI in China also hampered the revenue outlooks for selected industries in the Frankfurt exchange. SAP and Infineon lost 2.3% and 3.8%, succumbing to the sharp losses of tech shares on Wall Street overnight amid the selloff for Nvidia stock. Heavyweight auto manufacturers also retreated, with BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Porsche dropping between 1.7% and 1.2%.

Most leading Spanish stocks ended in the red, with significant losses for Inditex (-1.4%), BBVA (-2.6%), Amadeus (-2.1%), and Sabadell (-1.8%).

Chip giants ASML and Infineon plunged 6% and 3.6%, respectively, while SAP fell by 2.3%.

Ibovespa Rebounds on Dovish Expectations
Brazil Stock Market
The Ibovespa surged by 1.4% to above the 136,000 mark on Wednesday, driven by strong performances in the consumer discretionary sector and major banks, as investors absorbed recent economic data. Brazilian industrial production fell by 1.4% in July, partially offsetting the upwardly revised 4.3% increase recorded in June. This disappointing figure aligns with concerns that economic activity may decelerate in the latter half of the year, as the factors supporting GDP growth during the early months are expected to weaken, thereby contributing to dovish sentiments from the Brazilian central bank. The consumer discretionary sector led the day's gains, with few stocks declining. Magazine Luiza and Localiza saw strong increases of 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively, while the mega-cap beverage company Ambev enjoyed a robust gain of 1.5%.

Canadian Dollar Strengthens After BoC Decision
Canada Currency
The Canadian dollar strengthened toward 1.35 per USD, approaching the five-month high of 1.344 reached on August 27th, as investors digested the Bank of Canada’s recent interest rate decision amid foreign currency inflow concerns. The BoC opted for a widely anticipated 25bps rate cut, citing mounting economic concerns amid inflation edging closer to the central bank’s 2% target. Preliminary data suggest a downside risk for the third-quarter growth in the Bank’s July projections, while the labor market remains stagnant, with unemployment holding at 6.4%, hinting at further rate cuts in upcoming meetings. However, amid the lack of surprises, Macklem noted that sustained price pressures in the housing sector and specific services continue to keep inflation levels high, was seen as hawkish for the BoC moving forward, supporting the loonie.

Canada 10-Year Bond Yield Approaches 1-Year Lows
Canada Government Bond 10Y
The yield on Canada's 10-year government bond has dipped below 3.05%, approaching the one-year low of 3.02% reached on August 14, as it aligns with US Treasury yields, reflecting the anticipated adoption of looser monetary policies in both North American economies. The Bank of Canada has lowered its interest rate to 4.25% for the third consecutive meeting, signaling that further easing may be necessary should inflation continue to decline. Governor Tiff Macklem has voiced concerns regarding both the downside risks to economic growth and the potential for inflation to fall below the target, while markets anticipate ongoing rate cuts through 2025. Although economic growth was strong in the second quarter, the central bank remains cautious due to weak hiring and the pressures of elevated borrowing costs on consumers.

DXY Falls Below 101.5
United States Currency
The dollar index fell to below 101.5 on Wednesday, trimming its rebound from the 14-month low of 100 touched on August 19th amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver aggressive rate cuts this year. The JOLTS report showed that job openings unexpectedly fell to an over-three-year low in July, paring hopes of a hot jobs report on Friday, and aligning with concerns of a softer labor market that triggered a clear dovish pivot by Fed Chair Powell in his Jackson Hole speech. This added to the sharper-than-expected downturn in domestic manufacturing activity highlighted by the ISM PMI, also driving investors to heed the US’s resilience to higher interest rates. Consequently, investors increased their positions that reflect 125bps in rate cuts in the Fed’s three remaining decisions this year, compared to the consensus of 100bps in cuts last week. In the meantime, a rate cut by the BoC weakened the loonie and prevented a sharper drop for the DXY.

Traders digest the JOLTS report which showed the number of job openings fell way more than anticipated to 2021-lows, reinforcing expectations the labor market is cooling off, and raising bets for a 50bps cut by the Fed this month. Yesterday, a weak ISM Manufacturing PMI prompted renewed concerns about the health of the US economy. The key jobs report is due Friday. The tech sector recovered while energy underperformed. Shares of Nvidia halted its selloff with a 0.5% increase after plunging 9.5% on Tuesday. Other megacaps were mixed, including Apple (-1.4%), Amazon (-0.7%), and Meta (0.6%).

US 10-Year Yield at 4-Month Low, Curve Disinverts
United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to below the 3.8% threshold on Wednesday, its lowest in over 14 months, aided by higher demand for safer assets as a batch of soft economic data strengthened expectations of multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. The JOLTS report showed that job openings unexpectedly fell to an over-three-year low in July, driving markets to consider that Friday’s jobs report could disappoint expectations for a second consecutive month. This added to the sharper-than-expected downturn in domestic manufacturing activity underscored by the ISM PMI earlier this week, challenging the views that the US economy is resilient to higher borrowing costs. Consequently, markets increased their bets that the US central bank could deliver 125bps through the three remaining decisions this year, compared to 100bps from the end of August. In the meantime, the yield on the 2-year note fell below that of the 10-year for the first time since 2021.

Bank of Canada Cuts Rate by 25bps as Expected
Canada Interest Rate
The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by 25bps to 4.25% in its September 2024 meeting, as expected, to mark the third consecutive 25bps slash after having left the hiking cycle’s terminal rate of 5% for 10 months. The central bank noted that the extension of its cutting cycle was warranted as excess supply in the Canadian economy continued to put downward pressure on inflation. Additionally, policymakers reiterated some concerns about undershooting inflation targets, adding to their worries of overtightening. Also aligning with the need for looser financial conditions, the Governing Council noted that the labor market continued to slow in recent months, although wage growth remains elevated when compared to productivity. Still, the central bank noted that inflation remains elevated for shelter and selected services, noting that upside risks to price growth are also present.

Brazil Private Sector Activity Slows to 8-Month Low
Brazil Composite PMI
The S&P Global Composite PMI for Brazil dropped to 52.9 in August 2024 from a 25-month high of 56.0 in July, indicating the slowest expansion in private sector activity over the past eight months. The decline was driven by a renewed contraction in manufacturing output, while services continued to grow, albeit at their weakest pace since April. New orders increased for the eighth consecutive month, though at the slowest rate during this period. Cost pressures intensified, with input price inflation reaching its highest level in over two years, particularly affecting manufacturing. Prices charged for goods and services rose at the second-fastest pace in 18 months, led by sharper increases in manufacturing compared to services. Despite the slowdown, continued sales growth and positive outlooks helped sustain job creation across the private sector.

Brazilian Services Activity Eases to 4-Month Low
Brazil Services PMI
The S&P Global Brazil Services PMI fell to 54.2 in August 2024, down from 56.4 in July, reflecting a solid but slower expansion in business activity, marking the slowest growth since April. The decline was linked to softer demand conditions, although domestic demand continued to support new orders for the eleventh consecutive month. Currency depreciation, droughts, and lingering flood effects drove input costs to their highest in over two years, prompting a sharp rise in selling prices. Despite rising costs, employment growth reached a three-month high, fueled by robust business confidence and optimism about future sales and output. However, concerns remain over high borrowing costs, persistent inflation, and economic uncertainties, tempering overall business sentiment to a four-month low.

Bitcoin Falls to 1-Month low

Bitcoin fell toward $56,500 in September, the lowest since touching the five-month low of $54,700 in early August, tracking a pullback for riskier assets as the uncertain economic backdrop favored safer instruments in traditional sectors of financial markets. The recent decline coincided with a batch of pessimistic leading indicators on the US economy, namely PMIs, that reignited concerns that the Federal Reserve may be unable to achieve a soft landing following its aggressive tightening cycle to control inflation. Growth concerns in China were also detrimental to riskier assets, magnified by Beijing’s reluctance to stimulate its real economy. In the meantime, investors continued to assess the latest US presidential polls for hints on who might take office next year. Former President Trump and running mate Vance have signaled to be in favor of pro-cryptocurrency legislation, with the latter gaining popularity in the sector after reporting personal exposure to Bitcoin in the past.

UK Gas Approaches 1-Month Low
Commodity
UK natural gas futures fell to below 88.5 pence per therm in early September, testing their lowest levels in nearly one month and tracking the pullback in prices from other major European gas hubs amid evidence of ample supply. Flows from major Norwegian gas fields were reported to remain steady at the start of the month, albeit at expected lower volumes due to planned maintenance in key pipelines. This aided European storage facilities, which were last reported to be over 90% full, to erase concerns that unplanned supply shocks would threaten the energy availability in the upcoming northern winter season. Looking forward, the Turkish government signed a 10-year LNG deal with UK’s Shell with the option of redirecting shipments to Europe, aligned with Ankara’s goal to become a larger player in EU and Asian gas markets, and expanding Europe’s rebuilding of supply chains since shocks caused by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

South African Stocks Extend Fall
South Africa Stock Market
The JSE index was down for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, trading near 81,800 and aligning with its global peers, after disappointing PMI data from the US and China reignited concerns over the global outlook.

UK Services PMI Revised Higher
United Kingdom Services PMI
The S&P Global UK Services PMI rose to 53.7 in August of 2024 from 52.5 in the previous month, revised higher from 53.3, and well above the initial market consensus of 52.8, to extend the strong momentum for British service providers. It marked the tenth consecutive expansion in British services activity, at the sharpest pace since April. Inflows of new business expanded sharply, with survey respondents linking the higher demand with the improving economic backdrop, the prospect of lower borrowing costs, and lower political uncertainty following July’s general election. Also supporting output, firms noted a marked reduction in the backlogs of work in the period. Consequently, the higher demand for capacity drove employment numbers to increase. On the price front, input cost inflation fell to its lowest since January 2021, as lower costs for energy offset a sharp rise in wage pressures. Looking ahead, business activity expectations for the upcoming year remained upbeat.

The S&P Global UK Composite PMI rose to 53.8 in August of 2024 from 52.8 in the previous month, revised higher from the preliminary estimate of 53.4 and sharply above the initial market expectations of 52.9. It reflected the tenth consecutive expansion in British services activity, at the sharpest pace since April, amid upturns in both services (53.7 vs 53.5 in July) and manufacturing (52.5 vs 52.1). The aggregate level of new orders supported growth across the British private sector, with service providers expanding in line with those across Europe, while the robustness of factory demand significantly outperformed the contracting momentum for counterparts within the Eurozone. In the meantime, surveyees noted a sustained increase in employment levels. On the price front, firms reported the smallest increase in input costs since November of 2020.

Hong Kong Stock Market
The Hang Seng plunged 194 points or 1.1% to finish at 17,457 on Wednesday, receding for the third day as futures tied to US stocks slipped following a sharp tech selloff on Wall Street Tuesday and renewed concerns about US economy. Meanwhile, Caixin Service PMI in China came in less than expected in August despite the summer travel peak. In Hong Kong, private sector activity last month remained weak, shrinking for the 4th month due to falls in output, new orders, and buying levels. All sectors retreated, with an index tracking Hong Kong-listed energy shares tumbling over 4% as oil prices extended Tuesday's slump on global growth fears, along with signs that the political dispute in Libya may be resolved and the country's oil exports could resume.

Italian Private Sector Activity Rises Slightly Faster
Italy Composite PMI
The HCOB Italy Composite PMI increased to 50.8 in August 2024, from 50.3 the previous month, indicating a slightly faster expansion in the country's private sector. Although slowing, the services sector remained the main driving force of the economy (PMI at 51.4 vs 51.7 in July) while manufacturing activity contracted for a fifth month running (PMI at 49.4 vs 47.4). Manufacturers cut production volumes again, though the rate of contraction eased significantly from July, while services firms saw a slight increase in activity. Meanwhile, private sector new business contracted for the first time in eight months. At the same time, the rate of job creation was marginal and the slowest since January, dampened by a softer workforce expansion at service providers. As for prices, cost pressures for both manufacturers and service providers eased in August, though still sharp, while the rate of charge inflation increased as manufacturers raised their selling prices.

French Stocks Hit 2-Week Low
France Stock Market
The CAC 40 fell 0.9% to 7,505 on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level in two weeks, as part of a broader global stock sell-off fueled by concerns over the health of the global economy. The decline followed disappointing data from the US, where the ISM Manufacturing PMI indicated a fifth consecutive month of shrinking factory activity, while China's services sector data fell short of expectations. Meanwhile, domestically, the French Composite PMI was revised higher to 53.1 in August 2024, marking the first expansion in business activity since April and the strongest in over two years. The banking sector was among the hardest hit, with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, and Société Générale falling 0.7%, 1%, and 1.6%, respectively.

Lebanese Manufacturing PMI Contracts Further in August
Lebanon Manufacturing PMI
The BLOM Lebanon PMI dropped to 47.9 in August 2024, down from 48.3 in July, signaling a faster contraction in business activity amid regional instability, security concerns, political uncertainty, and weakened purchasing power. The volume of new work received by private sector companies declined in August due to reduced tourism demand and new export business contracted for the ninth consecutive month. Fears of an escalation in the Gaza conflict dampened business confidence, while broader economic and political issues also fueled pessimism. Purchasing activity fell at its fastest pace since December 2022, although employment levels saw a smaller decline. Meanwhile, despite rising input costs due to higher shipping fees and insurance premiums, the rate of inflation remained modest, with firms only slightly raising prices to offset increased costs.

Euro Area Private Sector Activity at 3-Month High
Euro Area Composite PMI
The HCOB Eurozone Composite PMI was revised slightly lower to 51 in August 2024 from a preliminary of 51.2, compared to 50.2 in July. The reading continued to point to the strongest performance in private sector activity in three months, driven by a quicker upturn in services (52.9 vs 51.9) while manufacturing remained weak (45.8 vs 45.8). It is the sixth straight month of expansion, the longest streak in over two years, but also highlights economic fragility in the eurozone as new orders, employment and business confidence deteriorated. On the other hand, there was a marked easing of cost pressures, with input prices rising at the softest pace in 2024 so far. However, output charges rose to the greatest extent since April. France and Spain were major forces behind August’s accelerated euro area expansion and improved growth rates were also seen in Ireland and Italy, while Germany bucked the trend by posting a second successive decline in private sector business activity.

French Private Sector Expands More than Initially Thought
France Composite PMI
The HCOB France Composite PMI rose to 53.1 in August 2024, up from an initial estimate of 52.7 and from 49.1 in July. This marked the first expansion in business activity since April and the strongest since May 2022, driven solely by a significant expansion in the services sector, likely boosted by the Olympic Games (55 vs. 50.1 in July). This growth countered a more pronounced decline in manufacturing production (43.9 vs. 44). Meanwhile, on demand, the sharp drop in factory orders offset the growth in the services sector. The latest survey data also showed the first contraction in employment since January, with services hiring mostly balancing significant job cuts in manufacturing. Despite fewer staff, backlogs fell at their fastest rate in seven months. On prices, selling charges rose the most since January, even as cost pressures eased. Lastly, business confidence remained broadly unchanged from July's six-month low.

Germany Services PMI Revised Down
Germany Services PMI
The HCOB Germany Services PMI was revised slightly down to 51.2 in August from a preliminary 51.4 and 52.5 in July, signaling a slowdown for the third consecutive month and marking the weakest performance in five months. The increase in new business was even smaller in August, reflecting a near-stall in demand conditions after a moderate upturn from April to July, exacerbated by a lack of new business from abroad. As a result, employment fell for the second month in a row, with the rate of job shedding accelerating slightly to the fastest pace since June 2020. As for prices, average input costs increased at the slowest rate in three and a half years. Despite this, inflation remained high by pre-pandemic standards, with output prices rising slightly faster than the 39-month low recorded in July. Finally, sentiment about the year-ahead outlook was relatively unchanged, hovering around the long-term average.

Euro Area Services PMI Revised Lower
Euro Area Services PMI
The HCOB Eurozone Services PMI rose to 52.9 in August of 2024 from 51.9 in the prior month, firmly above the initial market expectations of 51.9, but revised downwards from the flash estimate of 53.3. It was the seventh consecutive expansion in the Eurozone’s services activity, at the sharpest pace in three months, with support from a concurrent rise in new business inflows. This was entirely due to higher demand from the domestic market, as the level of new export business recorded a slight pullback. In the meantime, outstanding order volumes fell for a fourth month, and the faster pace of work completion was owed to the upturn in employment levels across the currency bloc’s service providers. On the price front, input costs faced by companies rose at the softest pace in six months, but output charges received rose at the fastest pace since May.

Germany Composite PMI Revised Slightly Down
Germany Composite PMI
The HCOB Germany Composite PMI was revised slightly lower to 48.4 in August 2024 from a preliminary of 48.5, down from 49.1 in July. The reading pointed to a quicker downturn in private sector activity, due to a marked drop in manufacturing (42.4 vs 43.2), alongside a slowdown in services (51.2 vs 52.5). Total new business decreased to the greatest extent since March, driven down by a sharp and accelerated drop in manufacturing new orders. Export sales meanwhile declined at a faster rate in both sectors. Also, the drop in staffing levels was the largest seen for four years and the rate of output price inflation ticked up to a six-month high and was broadly in line with the long-run average. On the cost front, a slower rise in services operating expenses was seen alongside a near-stabilisation in manufacturing purchase prices. Lastly, business expectations softened to a six-month low, primarily reflecting weaker manufacturing sentiment.

France Services PMI
The HCOB France Services PMI rose to 55.0 in August 2024, up from 50.1 in the previous month, pointing to the second consecutive month of expansion and the strongest growth since May 2022. French service providers reported a robust expansion in business activity, primarily driven by increased customer numbers. Data showed a modest recovery in demand conditions following back-to-back decreases in new orders in June and July. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in backlogs of work, signaling less strain on firms' capacity. However, employment growth weakened. On the price front, input cost inflation eased to a 39-month low. Nonetheless, French service providers raised their charges at the fastest pace since April. Finally, business confidence remained little-changed from July's seven-month low, as political uncertainty and weakness in the real estate sector dented optimism.

Italy Services Sector Growth at 7-Month Low
Italy Services PMI
The HCOB Italy Services PMI edged down to 51.4 in August 2024 from 51.7 in the previous month, missing market forecasts of 52.6. This also marked the lowest reading since January, weighed down by a renewed, albeit marginal decline in new work, with some firms reporting subdued customer interest. Similarly, new export business contracted after five consecutive months of growth, with the pace of decline matching the fastest since November 2023. Despite the subdued client demand, services firms continued hiring to manage current workloads. However, the rate of workforce expansion slowed to its weakest pace since January and was marginal overall. On the pricing front, input costs continued to rise, with some firms attributing the increase to higher staffing and services costs. Looking ahead, confidence among Italian service providers fell to its lowest level since last October.

Kenya Private Sector Expands in August

The Stanbic Bank Kenya PMI rose to 50.6 in August 2024 from 43.1 the previous month, indicating moderate stabilization in private sector operating conditions. Business activity increased output for the first time in three months, with a moderate growth rate that was the second fastest in over a year and a half. Moreover, firms increased their input purchases and saw a slight rise in inventories, supported by better supplier delivery times, although employment fell for the first time this year. On the price front, input price inflation hit a six-month high due to rising import fees and taxes, although it remained below historical trends. Selling prices also increased, but the rise was modest and partly offset by price discounting. Finally, business confidence dropped to a series low in August, with only 5% of companies expecting growth over the next 12 months.

Firms received higher volumes of new orders for the first time since April 2023, marking the strongest increase since August 2022 and ending a 15-month decline. Meanwhile, output fell moderately due to price pressures limiting operations, with cost pressures also leading to continued cuts in staffing and purchases for the third month. On prices, input costs surged to a three-month high, prompting firms to increase selling prices faster, though both input and output price inflation remained below historical averages. Finally, optimism surged to a decade-high as 54% of firms expect increased output, despite construction concerns over high interest rates.

Silver Slides to 3-Week Low
Commodity
Silver fell below $28 per ounce in early September, hitting its lowest level in three weeks as commodity prices came under pressure from weak US economic data that sparked recession fears. Prospects of a US recession dampens the demand outlook for materials including silver, prompting traders to rush for safer assets like the dollar, yen and government bonds. Still, markets expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates this month, with a crucial US jobs report due later this week likely influencing the size of the reduction. Silver has been a major beneficiary of the global push towards renewable energy, particularly from the solar industry, which relies heavily on the metal for photovoltaic cells. However, global economic uncertainties and growth concerns in top consumer China have been weighing on the outlook for the renewable energy sector.

Spain Services Sector Growth Slightly Tops Forecasts
Spain Services PMI
The HCOB Spain Services PMI rose to 54.6 in August 2024, up from 53.9 in July and slightly above the forecast of 54.5. The uplift was supported by higher activity driven by rising new work and export business, although growth rates for both metrics were slower than in July. Firms were encouraged to hire more staff in August, marking the twenty-third consecutive month of employment growth, with August’s increase surpassing the survey’s long-term average. Despite this, backlogs of work grew significantly. On prices, while input cost inflation remained high, the pace of price increases was the slowest since March 2021. Output charge inflation edged up from July and remained well above its historical trend. Looking ahead, although firms remain confident about the 12-month output outlook, sentiment fell to its lowest level since last December.

Growth continued to be primarily driven by the services sector (PMI at 54.6 vs 53.9), which contrasted with a slowdown in manufacturing activity (PMI at 50.5 vs 51). Private sector new order volumes kept rising robustly, and jobs continued to be added across the board, led by services. On the price front, input price inflation slowed to its lowest level in 13 months, while output price inflation remained solid and largely unchanged. Finally, confidence declined to its lowest level since the end of last year.

Germany 10-Year Bond Yield Falls to 2.2%
Germany Government Bond 10Y
The German 10-year government bond yield fell to 2.2% in the first week of September, the lowest in almost two weeks, amid a general cautious mood, as traders assess the health of the global economy and the monetary policy outlook while awaiting a key jobs report for the US due Friday. In Europe, investors bet the ECB will cut interest rates for a second time on its September 12th meeting, with the odds increasing after preliminary figures showed inflation in the Eurozone fell to 2.2% in August, the lowest level since July 2021, and core inflation also eased to 2.8% after three months at 2.9%. On the political front, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition lost two regional elections during the weekend, with the far-right AfD wining in the state of Thuringia and the centre-right CDU gained in Saxony. However, the far-right AfD is highly unlikely to be able to form a government, as other parties will not cooperate with it to have the majority needed to form a government.

The Services PMI fell to 52.9 in August 2024, down from 53.8 in the previous month, but remained in expansionary territory for the third consecutive period.

In contrast, the indices for new orders (54 vs. 53.9) and delivery times (56.7 vs. 55.9) showed improvement. The index for raw and input prices fell to 55.9 from 56.7 in July, indicating that price pressures in the service sector are easing to levels not seen since the pandemic in 2020.

Meanwhile, crude oil prices hit their lowest level since December 2023, due to signs of a deal to resolve a political dispute in Libya, and concerns over sluggish fuel demand after weak economic data in China and the US. Still, bets of sluggish output due to dry weather capped the slump. Meanwhile, the world's largest grower Indonesia is preparing for a wide use of palm-oil-based B50 biodiesel in 2025 after the deforestation rules by the EU. Market participants continue to follow reports that Beijing plans to start an anti-dumping probe into canola imports from Canada, as the impact on palm oil prices could be significant.

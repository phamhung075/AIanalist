The S&P 500 dropped 1.7%, the Dow lost 409 points, and the Nasdaq fell 2.5%. Big tech companies like Amazon (-3.6%), Alphabet (-4%) and Meta (-3.2%) saw significant losses, with chipmakers such as Broadcom (-10.3%) and Nvidia (-4.1%) also faced sharp declines. The August jobs report, which showed 142K new jobs versus the 161K expected, added to market jitters. In addition, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller\u2019s comments heightened expectations of a larger rate cut in September. He emphasized rising risks in the labor market and expressed openness to a more substantial rate cut if necessary. For the week, the S&P 500 lost about 4%, marking its worst week since March 2023. The Nasdaq sank 5.6% to book its worst start to September since 2001. The Dow slipped 2.5% and posted its steepest early-September decline since 2008."

Domestically, Canada\u2019s unemployment rate climbed to 6.6% in August 2024, the highest since October 2021 and above forecasts of 6.5%, reinforcing the Bank of Canada\u2019s view of a weakening labor market and supporting the case for further rate cuts. Economic activity also contracted for the first time in 13 months, with the Ivey PMI dropping to 48.2, its lowest since December 2020, amid slowing employment growth and intensified price pressures. Leading the declines on the Toronto exchange, Shopify plunged 4.1%, while weaker commodity prices weighed on the energy sector and key miners, with Suncor (-1.4%), Agnico (-1.9%), Imperial Oil (-2.2%), Canadian Natural (-1.3%), Barrick Gold (-1.9%), and Cenovus (-1.5%) underperforming. The TSX lost 2.4% for the week."

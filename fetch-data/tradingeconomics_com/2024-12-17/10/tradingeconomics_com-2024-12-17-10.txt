The Federal Reserve is set to announce its decision on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England on Thursday. At the same time, investors continued to weigh Moody's unexpected downgrade of France\u2019s credit rating from Aa2 to Aa3, citing concerns over worsening public finances amid political instability. On the corporate front, ArcelorMittal was the index\u2019s worst performer, with shares dropping 2.1%, while Vivendi, TotalEnergies, Saint-Gobain, and Veolia Environnement also posted notable declines, falling between 1.2% and 1.6%.

Adding to the bearish mood was a slight fall in palm oil buying from top consumer India last month, coupled with New Delhi's ongoing efforts to ease import dependence and achieve self-reliance in edible oils over the medium to long term.

New data showed that the output of primary aluminum in China rose by 3.6% from the previous year in November. This matched stronger supply earlier in the year as rainfall in the production hub of Yunnan supported the creation of hydropower for smelters. In turn, Beijing\u2019s willingness to let the yuan devalue drove prices for base metals with Chinese manufacturing hubs to pull back in dollar-denominated exchanges. This balanced against soaring alumina prices due to supply disruptions and Beijing\u2019s decision to end tax rebates on exports of semi-manufactured aluminum products in December, removing around five million tonnes of supply from the international market, according to market players\u2019 estimates."

Investors are focused on the Fed's policy decision, where another 25bps rate cut is widely anticipated. Markets will also closely watch the updated economic projections, particularly the outlook for interest rate cuts in 2025. Several key economic indicators are also due this week, including the flash S&P Global PMIs, retail sales and the PCE report. On the corporate front, Broadcom shares rose 5.5%, building on a nearly 24% surge on Friday that pushed the chipmaker's market capitalization to $1 trillion for the first time, following strong quarterly results. Also, MicroStrategy advanced more than 2% as the company will join the Nasdaq effective December 23rd.

        "content": "Coal Slumps to 7-Month Low Commodity Newcastle coal futures slumped toward $130 per tonne in December, the lowest since April, as the outlook of slowing demand for thermal coal in China magnified the impact of ample supply. The latest data showed that China\u2019s coal output averaged 14.27 million tons per day in November, the highest on record, accelerating sharply from the 12.28 million tons per day in the previous month to set up another record-breaking year of coal production in 2024 for the world's top producer. The development took place as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, with slowing demand driving power-intensive industries to cut back on output. Increasing concerns that stimulus from Beijing will not be able to trigger growth maintained the bearish pressure on thermal coal prices. In turn, demand was further pressured by ample rainfall in key Chinese manufacturing hubs, allowing hydroelectric power to be preferred over coal power."

B3 rose 2.5% after projecting higher disbursements for 2025, reflecting confidence in its growth prospects. Meanwhile Rede D'Or added 2% following the approval of a R$450 million interest on equity payment and a new share buyback program, lifting investor sentiment. However, the upward momentum was limited by persistent concerns over Brazil's fiscal and monetary outlook. Investors remain skeptical about the government's fiscal credibility and the Central Bank's future stance, particularly with a new board set to take office in January. Doubts linger over the prioritization of the inflation target, exacerbated by government criticism of recent monetary policy decisions. The fiscal package, deemed insufficient to stabilize public debt, has further fueled worries of an unsustainable debt-to-GDP trajectory."

The Indian GDP expanded by 5.4% annually in the quarter ending September, the least in seven quarters, prompting the RBI to lower its growth projections for the current financial year to 6.6% from 7.2%. Consequently, markets expect the central bank to commence lowering its key rate by the end of the financial year, supporting G-sec prices.

This comes amid growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may signal a more cautious pace of easing in 2025. While the Fed is widely expected to implement a 25-basis-point rate cut at its meeting on Wednesday, investors are focused on the updated policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s forward guidance. Currently, markets are pricing in a 93% probability of a quarter-point rate cut this week, though expectations have shifted, with traders now anticipating no further rate reduction in January. At the same time, concerns about potential inflationary pressures under a possible Trump administration have supported Treasury yields."

The rally was fueled by expectations of tighter supplies due to additional sanctions on major producers Russia and Iran, alongside optimism about China\u2019s plans to ramp up economic stimulus, which could drive demand. Additionally, recent interest rate cuts by central banks in Canada, Europe, and Switzerland lent support to oil prices. Traders are now shifting their attention to the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy decision later this week, where the bank is expected to deliver a 25bps cut. Such a move could spur economic growth, potentially boosting oil demand. Elsewhere, OPEC+ member United Arab Emirates announced plans to reduce oil shipments early next year as the producer group seeks greater discipline in meeting production targets."

This marked the 17th consecutive month of decreases, suggesting that Beijing\u2019s continuous attempts to mitigate the prolonged downturn in the property sector, such as reducing mortgage rates and slashing home buying costs, had yet to reverse conditions.

Total employment rose further while backlogs of work declined after rising in November. However, foreign sales remained weak, down at a steeper rate. On inflation, input price gained the most in four months, due to the impact of the yen's weakness on inputs from abroad. Consequently, firms raised selling prices at a faster pace, marking the highest inflation rate since May.
